Main Points of ¡§The global and regional constitution of nations: the view from East Asia¡¨ & ¡§Western Nationalism and Eastern Nationalism: Is There a Difference That Matters¡¨ 
Nationalism and Imperialism 
- The two ideas, originated from the West, are different, but for Asians, they seem to be inseparable 

- Externally, the system of nation-states was closely associated with imperialism abroad, for example, colonization and capitalist competitions 

- Internally, nationalism spurs the doctrine of rights for self-determination and independence 

- Hence, when nationalism spread to East Asia, it was seen as the goal and the means of competition for global resources and superiority among nation-states. The transformation of older empires and kingdoms into nation-states was viewed as the way of survival in a competitive world 

- The interpenetrated model of nationalism and imperialism was adapted by Japanese to the historical circumstances of East Asia with long-lasting effects 


 
Recognition and misrecognition 
Nations become nations not only through recognition by other powerful nations, but also through a disavowal or misrecognition of these constitutive imitations. 
„« How recognition works (being recognized by others as a nation-state) 

- The legitimate authorities overhaul their legal and social systems so that other nations and powerful multi-national entities, like WHO/ United Nations, may recognize them as such 

- The historical and cultural interconnectedness of East Asia provided the framework for historical narrative of political community 

- For instance, to gain recognition from the West, Japan on the one hand identified itself with the weak and victimized ¡§Asian brethren¡¨; on the other, developed several colonies 

„« How misrecognition works (misrecognize their origins within the state) 

- Nationalism as the predominant ideology of the nation-states tend to locate sovereignty in the ¡¥authentic¡¦ history and traditions of the people 

- The national history narrative would legitimate the authoritative structure for their creation and function, and maintain the continuity of a people or a race, to fit the nationalist project 

- Distinguishing the authenticity of their nation also propels them toward global recognition 


This founding dualism tends to produce a structural tension between a desire to belong to or partake of a global cultural and to retreat to the national or more local haven. 
 
Different kinds of nationalism 
- Nationalism is an ideology and politics but not uniform or monolithic 

- Namely, anti-imperialist nationalism, radical ethnic nationalism, statist nationalism, popular nationalism 

- Nationalism adapted to capitalist globalization gradually plays a greater role in enhancing the competitive power of a society as much as to protecting society from competitors 

- The impetus for the resurgence of nationalism may have moved from the state to the people 

- Creole nationalism pioneered by settler colonizing population but it blends settlers with indigenous peoples; many nations share the same language but they do not imagine they own this language, e,g, Francophone, Sinophone, etc. 


- Official nationalism emanated from the state as a reactionary response (territorial control) to popular nationalism from below (popular liberation); but they can combine to convert an empire to a nation-state 

- Modern nation mainly bases itself firmly on the idea of future progress (e.g. the Han Chinese manifest themselves as the Future whereas the ethnic minorities as the Past) though it also manipulates the past to form cohesion 

- Linguistic nationalism marks off each nation by its own peculiar language and literary culture 

- Electronic media communication, combined with massive migrations, create long-distance nationalism  


 
Nationalisms in the West and the East are very similar 
 
- There is no distinctively Asian form of nationalism; the East-West dichotomy is not theoretically and empirically justifiable, though they are valuable for comparative study; it¡¦s difficult to determine where the West or the East begins or ends 

- Indeed, Japan¡¦s Meiji nationalism was similar to those 19th century nationalisms found in Tsarist Russia, Ottoman Turkey, the Imperial Britain 


 
Conclusion 
- The dialectic between the globalization and misrecognition, and the relationship between statist and non-state nationalism are linked and fundamental to the historical understanding of nationalism 

- The current trend of post-Cold War globalization has produced a high degree of interdependence in East Asia, however, they may be losing some of their authority as custodians of authenticity, which likely brings about the reinforcement of nationalism
